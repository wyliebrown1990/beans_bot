Try to manually run docker-compose installation:
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose version

THEN will need to connect to RDS instance with psql to create db interview_bot
THEN update docker-compose to connect to the RDS Instance URI
